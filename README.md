# üè• **Medical Condition & Drug Recommendation System** üíä

This project is an advanced NLP-based application designed to provide real-time medical condition analysis and drug recommendations. By utilizing **LDALR** (Latent Dirichlet Allocation with Latent Recurrent) and a **BERT-based LLM (Large Language Model)**, the system aims to assist healthcare providers in **reducing patient wait times** in hospitals across Ontario and Canada. The app analyzes user input to return likely medical conditions and corresponding drug recommendations, improving both efficiency and patient care.

## üß† **About the Project**

The **Medical Condition & Drug Recommendation System** leverages state-of-the-art NLP techniques to streamline the diagnostic process. It is especially valuable in **high-volume healthcare settings**, such as hospitals in Ontario and Canada, where patients often face long waiting times for consultations.

The application is powered by:
- **LDALR Model**: Utilized for topic modeling to extract medical conditions from textual input (e.g., symptoms, history, etc.).
- **BERT-based LLM**: A transformer model fine-tuned to predict drugs based on the identified medical condition, optimizing therapeutic recommendations.

The goal of this project is to provide quicker, more efficient preliminary insights that can aid healthcare providers in prioritizing cases and accelerating treatment decisions.

## ‚ú® **Features**

- **Real-time medical condition prediction**: Uses patient input (e.g., symptoms, history) to predict possible medical conditions.
- **Drug recommendation system**: Based on the detected condition, the system suggests appropriate drugs and therapies.
- **Intuitive UI**: User-friendly interface for healthcare professionals to input patient data easily.
- **Built for scalability**: Designed to handle a large number of users, ideal for hospital systems.
- **Language agnostic**: Works with multiple languages, providing broad accessibility.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Technologies Used**

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
  - **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** for language understanding.
  - **LDALR (Latent Dirichlet Allocation with Latent Recurrent)** for topic modeling and medical condition extraction.
  
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `transformers` for BERT integration.
  - `tensorflow` or `pytorch` for model training and inference.
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data processing.
  - `flask` or `fastapi` for creating the backend API.
  
- **Web Development**:
  - Frontend: `React` or `Vue.js` for creating the user interface.
  - Backend: Python-based frameworks like `Flask` or `FastAPI`.

- **Databases**:
  - **SQLite**

## üõ†Ô∏è **Installation**

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip or conda (for package management)
- An environment with GPU (recommended for model training)

## üìä **Usage**

The application consists of two primary features:

1. **Condition Prediction**: 
   - Input symptoms or medical history into the form.
   - The system returns a list of likely medical conditions based on your input.

2. **Drug Recommendation**: 
   - Based on the predicted medical condition, the system suggests a list of recommended drugs and treatments.

## üìö **Model Training**

The core models used for this system are **BERT-based** and **LDALR**. Below are the high-level steps to fine-tune or train the models:

### BERT Fine-Tuning
To fine-tune BERT for medical data:
- Download a pre-trained BERT model from the [Hugging Face Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models).
- Fine-tune it on your medical dataset, such as the **MIMIC-III** database or other relevant medical corpora.

### LDALR Training
To train the LDALR model for medical topic extraction:
- Use a medical corpus (symptoms, diagnoses, etc.) to train the model.
- Preprocess the text data to feed it into the LDALR algorithm for topic modeling.

For both models, pre-trained versions can be downloaded and integrated directly for faster setup, or custom training can be done based on specific medical datasets.
